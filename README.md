# docker

## why container needed ?

- when u have something deployed on physical machine
- it  is hard to make it scale like you there are 50k req/user
- u need to code there, boot up again after updating hard parts 
<br/>

- here public cloud came into picture like aws,azure,gcp, digital ocean 
- they provide cloud machine (Server)
<br/>

- virtual machine- inside your windows you can boot up new virtual machine that can be linux (vm ware/virtual box app)
<br/>

- contianers give u more security
- 2 containers are totally isolated
- docker help us to setup own containers
